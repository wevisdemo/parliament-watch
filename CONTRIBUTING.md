# Contributing Guideline

1. First, and most importantly, make sure you read the [README.md file](README.md).
2. Read the [issues](https://github.com/wevisdemo/parliament-watch/issues) carefully, comment on the issue you want to work on, and we'll assign it to you.
3. Feel free to open a new issue, if you found a bug or have some idea.
4. Fork the project if you don't have permission to directly edit this repository. Checkout from the branch specified in the issue.
5. Open a pull request (PR) with the same name as the issue. Target the branch specified in the issue. The maintainer will review your work and might give you some feedback before merging.
6. If your work isn't ready for review, add "[WIP]" at the beginning of the PR title.
7. Feel free to ask questions or discuss on GitHub's issues or PRs in English or Thaiâ€”whichever you're more comfortable with.
8. Open-source maintenance is not everything we do, but we'll try to be as responsive as possible.

Thanks for contributing, and happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
